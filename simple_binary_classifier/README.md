### Simple Convolutional Neural Network 

#### Resources
1. [Guide code is based on](https://becominghuman.ai/building-an-image-classifier-using-deep-learning-in-python-totally-from-a-beginners-perspective-be8dbaf22dd8)

#### Use
1. Make sure you have a directory structure similar to:
```
training_set/cats
training_set/dogs
test_set/cats
test_set/dogs
```
2. Start the training:
```
python binary_cnn.py
```



#### Comments
I started here to better understand what I was working with in terms of neural
networks, the code here has lots hardcoded and uses a simple single layer
convoluted network.
